# Buzzfeed News Scraper

## What Is This?
Here, we have a simple app for scraping articles from popular news site Buzzfeed. Users are allowed to save scraped articles to a public collection, remove them, and leave comments.

## Why?
This was an exercise in dynamically getting data from a source that is easily referenced and manipulating it to display it on a simple page using MVC paradigm. 

## Who is this for?
This is for anyone who reads Buzzfeed articles or wants to see an example of an article scraper that dynamically displays content at the click of a button. I chose Buzzfeed because the articles are free to access... No other reason.

## What's under the hood? 
Several technologies were carefully stitched together to make this happen: 
* NodeJS
* NPM
* Express
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* MLab
* Axios
* Heroku
